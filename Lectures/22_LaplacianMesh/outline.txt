*Final project rubric

*Ask class if it's okay for assignment 3 to be in Python

--------------
*Motivate problem at a high level, show dragging vertex versus Laplacian warping
-Explain how we try to retain relative information

*Show the big picture of curvature of plane curves

*Go into more detail: Define parameterized curves, show derivative of tangent is normal to tangent

*Show discrete curvature estimate by difference of discrete derivatives on a 1D curve

*Show curvature on surfaces, define mean curvature using Keenan Crane's figures

*Define laplacian matrix carefully, show how it's like curvature

*Show equivalent definition of graph laplacian (mention generalization)

*Explain how this matrix has "rank N-1" (explain with the integral + C analogy)

*Define anchors, define least squares solution

*Show a bunch of examples

*Explain how for irregular meshes, this doesn't really make sense, so need to use cotangent weights
-Show my homer example
*but also explain how cotangent weights become negative for obtuse angles

*Show how the Laplacian is not rotation invariant
(show octopus figures from Sorkine paper, and spikes)

*Show applications (figures from paper)
-detail transfer, mesh mixing, mesh smoothing

*Show laplacian on images
