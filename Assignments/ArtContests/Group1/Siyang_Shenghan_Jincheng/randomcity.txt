I wrote a function to generate a city scene with randomly sized 
streets and buildings and randomly placed receiver and source. Click the very top button in 
index.html to build a random city. Some parameters are set as local varibles in the function, 
such as dimension of the city, ranges of building size and height, and range of street width. 
Note there is a scale factor m used to scale the entire city, so for example setting it to 0.01 
gives a 1:100 miniature. By default m=1 so that the city is "to scale" (i.e. all the dimensions 
and sizes are in meters). I set the external viewpoint to be from the highest point of the city, 
which might makes the city looks smaller, but it actually is to scale
