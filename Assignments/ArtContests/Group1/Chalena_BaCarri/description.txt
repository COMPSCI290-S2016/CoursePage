Our art submission depicts a tennis court. Our idea was that the receiver could model one
player, while the source models another. Enable transmission to see all the mistakes it is
possible to make by hitting in the net or out, and disable the transmission to see where not
to hit the ball (you don’t want to hit it at right at the other player do you?!). Tennis is
tough, huh? There’s an art to it.
