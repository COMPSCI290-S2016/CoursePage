*Talk about planar graphs, prove Euler's formula there

*Show stereographic projection, then prove for convex polyhedra which can be stretched to sphere

*Use Euler's formula to prove there are only 5 regular polyhedra

*Show constructing regular polyhedra from cubes

*Show constructing torus, show euler characteristic is 0 [raffle point problem]

*State alternating sum of betti numbers without proof
-What's the euler characteristic of two spheres?  What about the Euler characteristic of a sphere plus a torus?

*Define boundary, show euler characteristic of disc is 1
