Rotation matrix visualization:

*Talk about matrix interpretations and show examples in 2D
-Show rotation matrix, shear matrix
*Motivate homogenous coordinates in 2D (ask them if they can come up with a matrix that does it, and show mathematically why this is impossible)
*Start working with homogenous coordinates, and show how rotating + translating is not the same as translating + rotating
*Show how normals have to be treated differently in general
*Jump to 3D and show rotation matrices around different axes


Interactive demos with glMatrix in Javascript to keep things exciting, including shader demos
