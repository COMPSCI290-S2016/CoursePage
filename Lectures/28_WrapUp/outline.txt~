My Teaching Philosophy / Logistics:
*Forced you guys to learn Python/Numpy.  I believe this is the future of data analytics

*You now have *a ton* of code to do 3D geometry both in the browser and in Python.  Use it!

*Art contests so that you own your work

*Skeleton code

Advice / Post-Course Homework:
*Always look back at what you've learned
-"I don't know anything"
-Things coming into focus

*It's not about being a "genius"...
...it's about challenging yourself and growing

*Delegation, group work

*Nobody's special, and as a result, everyone is special

*I don't know everything


*Have an eye towards authenticity (takes widsom, which takes experience)

*Be a patron and protector of the liberal arts

*Stereotype Threat

*Stay in Touch!
