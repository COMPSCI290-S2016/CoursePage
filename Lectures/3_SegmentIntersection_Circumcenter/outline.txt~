Announcement: Only 2D circumcenter

1) Cross product definition review

2) Go over 2D line segment intersection
-Mention CCW

-Cramer's rule for 2D line segment intersection

-Extension to 3D (adding)

-Problems with 3D (skew lines)

-Show what happens with numerical precision if trying to use slope



3) Go over triangle circumcenter
-Question to class: How many degrees of freedom needed to represent circle in the plane? (have class vote?)
-Present algebraic and vector form equations for circle
-Raffle point question: have a group find an example of a triangle where a circumcenter is outside

*Show Delaunay triangulation
-Note that the boundary is the convex hull
-Draw dual on the board
-Explain brute force algorithm








Time Permitting:
*Highlight the importance of using graphics to help debug.  Show real time example with triangle circumcenter.  Put up vec3 documentation on one screen

*Note on numerical precision
