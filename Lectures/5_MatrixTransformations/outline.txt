Software TODO:
*Python script to automatically generate results of scaling by 2D matrices
*Python script to generate 3D cube transformations with OpenGL
*Javascript app to show column interpretation of matrix transformations

--------------------------
Rotation matrix visualization:
http://bl.ocks.org/enjalot/7b226e90c7338c69606b

*Dot product and column addition interpretations
-Lots of examples: Scale, rotation, flip, shear
-GUI (time permitting)



*Orthogonal matrix definition

*Show rotation matrices in 3D

*Inverses

*Homogenous coordinates
(ask them if they can come up with a matrix that does translation, and show mathematically why this is impossible)

*Projection matrices

*Hint at matrices which aren't square

*Show how system of equations can be interpreted geometrically

*Show example with rotation + translation versus translation + rotation to highlight non-commutativity


Other:
*Transpose definition
-Transpose properties?
