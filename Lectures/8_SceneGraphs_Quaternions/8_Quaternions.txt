Connection to line segment intersection trick

Quaternions:
*Start with complex numbers and 2D rotations

*Show how multiplication by each unit vector is a 90 degree rotation in 4D

*Show quaternion interpolation (use as a foreshadowing of geodesics later in the course)

*Raffle point problem: Multiply two quaternions together right after teaching it
